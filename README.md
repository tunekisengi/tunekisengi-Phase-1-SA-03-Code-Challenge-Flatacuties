**Flatacuties Web App**
This is a simple web application called "Flatacuties" that allows users to view and interact with a list of cute characters. Users can see the character names and images, and even add votes for their favorite characters. The character data is fetched from an API, and the web app is dynamically updated with this data.

**How to Use**
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You will be greeted with the title "FLATACUTIES" and a list of character names (which are fetched from an API).
Click on a character's name to view more detailed information.
In the detailed view, you can see the character's image, the total number of votes received, and a form to add more votes.

**Code Structure**
The HTML file (index.html) contains the structure of the web app.
The CSS styling is defined in an external stylesheet (style.css).
JavaScript functionality is implemented in the index.js script, which fetches character data from an API and dynamically updates the content.

**How to Customize the Data**
To customize the character data or add more characters, you can update the API endpoint (http://localhost:3000/characters) in the JavaScript code. You can also modify the structure of the data in the API to include character names, images, and vote counts.

**Styling**
The provided style.css file adds a pleasant visual design to the web app, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.
